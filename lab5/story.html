                                There is always one friend in a group, who always break  things. That was me in my group . When I was pursuing my undergraduation, me and my friends planned fora trip.
                                We were about to leave and I broke window glass while closing. That apartment my friends rented on lease. Owner used to come to house in every second week of month for rent.
                                So that trip was cancled because of me.                   
                        </p>
                       <p>
                                We spent 1800 Rs to fix that window. It took 3 hours to finish the work. And finally we ended on watching a movie in theater. All my friends were saying "keep him(me) away from glass or any glass things". 
                       </p>
                       <p>
                           We were lucky because on very next day owner came to house. As usual our house was completely mess. We got a morning lecture about 'How to Keep Our House'. Luckly he didn't notice the window. He took rent and gone and after that my friends started shouting at me.   
                       </p>
                       <p>
                           I broke many things in my  undergrad but luckly I didn't get caught. I will explain some other time  What and how much things I broke.
